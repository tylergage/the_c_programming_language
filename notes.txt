Brain storm some ideas here:
- Try out some build tools
- Unit testing, also evaluate some different options
- There was something over at memfault related to the 


GBU Make:
gcc -o helloworld main.c

Nice Makefile example I am going to use from here

Let's think about how we want to setup the user interface. Essentially I want something easily expandable. Just need to put in a name of the user input, and follow that up with a function, etc. 

IDEAS:
Structure of a string, and a function. 
Think we need a separate file pair, diagnostics? Or maybe user input. 


Got a decent setup for the GUI, we can still get a couple new files for this.

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate a number of different programming excercises in the C programming language. Questions are taken from different books or the internet and chosen on a whim for what I find interesting or would serve as a good challenge. There is a CLI framework present for navigating different questions and excercises. This program is created and maintained by Tyler Gage. 


TODO:
- move the GUI to its own files DONE
- add descriptions for each command, also add info command DONE

- message to make it obvious when back in the main menu after the excercises, clean up excercise instrucions
- Did not even realize we did 1-13 wrong, its supposed to be lengths, lets fix it
- Do one more question

- coding standard cleanup
